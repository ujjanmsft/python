        <h1>Chicken Choila <em>-Nepali Spicy Grilled Chicken</em></h1>
        <p>Chicken Choila is a traditional Newari dish from Nepal, known for its bold, spicy, and smoky flavors. It's typically made with grilled or roasted meat, marinated in a pungent mix of spices, mustard oil, garlic, ginger, and green chilies. While traditionally made with buffalo meat, chicken is a popular and readily available alternative. It's often served as an appetizer or a side dish.</p>
